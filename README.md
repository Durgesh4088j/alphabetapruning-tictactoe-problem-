Overview

This project implements Tic-Tac-Toe using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, a fundamental technique in Artificial Intelligence for game playing.

Alpha-Beta Pruning optimizes the Minimax algorithm by eliminating branches in the game tree that do not affect the final decision, making it faster and more efficient.

🔹 Features

Two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game (Human vs AI)

AI uses Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning

Optimal moves guaranteed by the AI
Concepts

Minimax Algorithm: Finds the optimal move by assuming both players play optimally.

Alpha-Beta Pruning: Skips unnecessary branches in the game tree to improve efficiency.

Heuristic Evaluation: Scores board positions based on winning, losing, or tie conditions.
